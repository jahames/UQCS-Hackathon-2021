# UQCS-Hackathon-2021 - An Automatic Trivia Question Generator

The aim of the project is to create and automatic trivia question gerator that uses data from wikipedia to generate random questions on demand. 

## Backend 

Python based code that uses the wikipedia python package to generate questions.

## Frontend

I dunno James, you can put something here. 
James: yeah flask lol. HTML templates. SocketIO to update game state.

## Setup
pip install -r pip.txt (python3 src/index.py to start) or run in pipenv to start server.
Connect to server in a browser (cookies enabled), put in name and roomID, then click create.
Once room has started and the first question has loaded, users can join by entering a name and roomID, then clicking join.
Dark Souls Mode does not work.
